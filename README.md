# Selfmade-Quizapp

*A small self made Quizapp in Python, just for fun, visualized via pygame*

If you want to try it, just pull the files down and *make sure* you have all the imports installed via pip, _especially pygame_!

The Question Database is rather small, but I will expand it or change it to a bigger online database sometimes in the future...
